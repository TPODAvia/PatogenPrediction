# Results From PathogenFinder2
## 'File Name' has the input file, 'Prediction_0-3' has the predictions of each neural network, 'Prediction Mean' has the mean of the 4 neural networks, 'Prediction_STD' has the standard deviation of the four predictions,
## 'Phenotype' has if the prediction is pathogenic or non pathogenic, and 'Binary Prediction Mean' has the value of the prediction as 0 (non pathogenic) or 1 (pathogenic).
